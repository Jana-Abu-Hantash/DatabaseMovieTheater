# Movie Theater E-commerce Database

## Overview
This project focuses on creating a comprehensive e-commerce platform for a movie theater. The database system is designed to manage and store information about movies, showtimes, user accounts, employees, tickets, booking information, and more. It aims to facilitate the selling of online tickets and provide a seamless experience for both moviegoers and theater administrators.

## Introduction
The database is designed to serve as the backend for an e-commerce platform, helping movie theaters to efficiently manage and streamline their operations. The project involves designing an ER diagram, creating relational schemas, and implementing the database with SQL.

## Key Components

### Database Design
- **ER Diagram and Schema**: Detailed design of entities, attributes, and relationships catering to the needs of a movie theater.
- **Normalization**: Ensured that the database tables are normalized to avoid redundancy and maintain data integrity.

### Tables

- **Users**: Stores user account information.
- **Booking Details**: Records user payments and booking details.
- **Tickets**: Manages ticket sales and details.
- **Shows**: Keeps track of movie showtimes and availability.
- **Movies**: Contains information about movies shown in the theater.

### Functionality

- **Back-End**: The database provides data about movies, times, and seats. It allows employees direct access to alter the database.

## Outcome
The project provided hands-on experience in creating a database from scratch, identifying and fixing errors, and enhancing functionality with views and triggers. The database effectively supports the e-commerce platform, offering a robust system for managing movie theater operations.
